# Adding Photos to Your Apartment Website

## ðŸ“¸ **How to Add Your Apartment Photos:**

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Photos**
- Take high-quality photos of your apartment
- Recommended size: 800x600 pixels or larger
- File formats: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- Keep file sizes under 2MB for fast loading

### **Step 2: Name Your Photos**
Rename your photos to match the paths in `main.py`:
- `photo1.jpg` - Living room or main area
- `photo2.jpg` - Kitchen
- `photo3.jpg` - Bedroom
- `photo4.jpg` - Bathroom
- `photo5.jpg` - Exterior or balcony

### **Step 3: Place Photos Here**
Simply drag and drop your photos into this `static/images/` folder.

### **Step 4: Update main.py (if needed)**
If you want different photo names or more photos, edit the `photos` list in `main.py`:

```python
'photos': [
    '/static/images/your-photo-name.jpg',
    '/static/images/another-photo.jpg',
    # Add more photos as needed
]
```
